# Algo-Trading-Scripts

I will keep updating this repo as and wehn i come up with my new trading strategies coded in python. It uses zerodha's kite connect python client api to automatically place orders,
telegram api to upodate my trades.

All the scripts are hosted on aws and are all time active and tracking the market.

I will make a different repo for all the live scanner I use, and TradingView indicators that i have develped for the ease in manual analysis.
