# Algo-Trading-Scripts

I will keep updating this repo as and when i come up with my new trading strategies coded in python. It uses zerodha's kite connect python client api to automatically place orders,
telegram api to update my trades.

All the scripts are hosted on aws and are all time active and tracking the market.

I will make a different repo for all the live scanner I use, and TradingView indicators that i have developed for the ease in manual analysis.
To check out telegaram bot code and kite connect snippets, view my other repo(s)

I will soon update the Backtesting results of individual strategies.

Live Trades are not yet synced but will soon be synced to the telegram channel when backtesting is complete.
